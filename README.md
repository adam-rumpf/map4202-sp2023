This repository contains selected programs used in class during my Spring 2023 section of [MAP 4202](https://floridapolytechnic.instructure.com/) (Optimization Theory). Please feel free to download, use, and modify them in any way you like!

I will be using this repository to post example code used in class, as well as project code to be used in assignments. Assignment prompts posted to Canvas may also include links to the relevant folders of this repo.
